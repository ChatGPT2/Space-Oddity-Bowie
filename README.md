# API key acquisition

To use the "shortcut" to call the ChatGPT API, an OpenAI API key is required. You can go to the OpenAI official website to get it for free, the steps are as follows:

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com to register an account and log in.
2. Click on the avatar in the upper right corner and select "View API keys".
3. Click the "Create new secret key" button on the right side of the page to generate an API key.
4. Copy the API key for backup. Note that the API key only appears once. If you forgot it, regenerate a new one.


> Note: There is a fee to use the API, the price is $0.0020 / 1K tokens, 1k tokens is approximately equal to 750 words, or 500 Chinese characters. New users of OpenAI will have a credit of $5 to be used during your first 3 months. Therefore, it is best not to share the API key with others. If the API key is leaked, you can delete it in the OpenAI background and generate a new one.
